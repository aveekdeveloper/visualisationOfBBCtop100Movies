In this project we have tried to come up with visualisation for Top 100 movies from the BBC 2016 database.

This file also contains description of folder contents.
This project has three parts and hence three views.

###index.html###
We have presented the three parts of our work in tabbed view. There is a bug with the Map view when loaded up via the index.html, So better load it up seperately. We will try to fix the bug soon.

###Part 1: overview###
Folder:/

File: overview.html

Description: In this part we present the overview of all the movies.

###Part 2: Details view###
Folder: details

File: Part2.html

###Part 3: Map view###
